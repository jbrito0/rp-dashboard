# Images Directory

This directory is for storing profile pictures of the top performers in the dashboard.

## How to Add Profile Pictures

1. **Naming Convention**: Save images with the performer's name in lowercase, replacing spaces with underscores.
   - Example: If a performer's name is "Juan Pérez", save the image as `juan_pérez.jpg`

2. **Supported Formats**: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.jfif`

3. **Image Size**: Recommended size is around 100x100 pixels or larger (will be automatically resized to 100px width)

4. **Examples**:
   - `juan_pérez.jpg` - Will be displayed for performer "Juan Pérez"
   - `maria_gonzalez.png` - Will be displayed for performer "María González"
   - `carlos_rodriguez.jpeg` - Will be displayed for performer "Carlos Rodríguez"

## Automatic Display

The dashboard will automatically:
- Look for images matching the performer's name
- Display the actual photo if found
- Show a placeholder 👤 icon if no image is found

## Tips

- Use clear, professional headshots
- Ensure good lighting and image quality
- Keep file names consistent with the data in your Google Sheet
